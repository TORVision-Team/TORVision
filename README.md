As the Forensic Engineer of this project, my role focuses on uncovering the story behind the data. Every log, every anomaly, every trace point left in the system is a potential clue and my responsibility is to study those clues, validate findings, and translate them into clear, actionable insights for the team.

While other branches build, implement, and innovate, this branch ensures that nothing goes unnoticed. Whether it's analysing forensic logs, identifying unusual system behaviour, or verifying the integrity of collected evidence, this branch adds the essential “trust layer” to our entire workflow.

This Branch Covers:-

-> Collecting and examining forensic logs

-> Identifying patterns, anomalies, or suspicious activity

-> Validating whether operations in other branches followed expected behaviour

-> Documenting findings in a clean, readable, investigation-style format

-> Helping the team make informed decisions backed by evidence

This Branch's Need:-

In any collaborative system, especially those dealing with sensitive workflows, having strong forensic analysis ensures transparency, accountability, and reliability. This branch protects the project from overlooked issues and provides clarity when uncertainty arises.

My Responsibility:-

I handle the forensic report files stored under forensic_logs/, review them carefully, and maintain a consistent structure so the entire team can rely on the data without confusion. My work ensures that every discovery is well-explained, human-understandable, technically sound.
